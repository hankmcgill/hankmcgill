I'm Hank McGill (he/him), a New York City based Data Engineering Fellow at Civera. My expertise is in accessible design, CI/CD, and full-stack web development. Most recently I helped develop Fantoons.xyz as a senior software engineer.  As an active member of the open source community, I helped build kafkaPRAAG, an Apache Kafka health and metrics visualization developer tool. Before I became a full-stack dev, I spent five years creating static sites for bands in Los Angeles. I speak French and I've got an insatiable interest in world history. I bring a diverse skill set and unwavering dedication to every project I undertake - and I'm always down to talk about traveling on credit card points.

Recent talks include accessible design (a11y) at NYC JavaScript meetup.
