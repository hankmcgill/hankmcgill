# Hello world!

I'm Hank McGill (he/him).  I'm a React-based full-stack developer working in TypeScript, Node, and postgreSQL, specializing in front-end development.  Welcome to my GitHub profile!

After growing up in Paris, I moved to Los Angeles to attend Loyola Marymount University and played in indie rock bands for almost ten years.  I got to tour the world and perform with some of my favorite artists - all as I was developing websites for musicians and other artists.
