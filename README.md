Hello! I'm Hank McGill (he/him).  After growing up in Paris, I moved to Los Angeles to attend Loyola Marymount University and played in indie rock bands for almost ten years.  I got to tour the world and perform with some of my favorite artists - all as I was developing websites for musicians and other artists.
